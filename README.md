# PyCuckoo

Does exactly what a cuckoo do. Make random noises at random points of time.

Uses the pydub module/package.

## Usage

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python cuckoo.py

```

And wait. And wait. And wait a bit more.

At every half hour you'd hear one cuckoo, and on the hour, 
the corresponding number.

IDK, maybe just add it to a login profile or something.
